# LinuxScripts
My little collection of nice Linux Scripts for easing my work.

## Includes:
- internetOverUSB
	- Sets up the BeagleBone Black to use the host PC for a default Gateway to the internet. Also sets the nameserver to 8.8.8.8, to use DNS correctly, and enable work requiring internet access. Also sets the system clock according to NTP. This example is based upon the work of Derek Molloy in his Exploring BeagleBone book: https://exploringbeaglebone.com , as well as my Embedded/Systems Programming teacher, Klaus Kolle: https://klaus.ede.hih.au.dk .

## To be included:
- enableBBBInternet
	- For debian based OS'es to enable the Beaglebone traffic to be Masqueraded through the host debian OS.
